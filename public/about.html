<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Manufacturing professional transitioning into IT. I started learning to code formally in the year 2020 during the
covid-19 pandemic. In 2021, I got a job in a Manufacturing company as a Production Analyst. The job required that I
relocate to a remote area where I had no access to constant power supply like I used to. While working as a Production
Analyst in the company, I could not continue developing my programming skills. My laptop had become
inefficient as the battery does not last long.
</p>

<p>In the year 2022, I got another Laptop with the intention of returning to my IT skills development. This time around I
had decided to learn Devops Engineering. I started learning Linux which is the core foundation to learning DevOps. I
managed to create time for DevOPs in the midst of my busy schedule at work. In March 2023, I got another job which
requires that I relocate again to another State. In this job, I was working from Monday to Saturday which slowed down my
learning. I would go to work Monday to Saturday and then go to Church on Sunday. Power supply was also not constant in
this location.
</p>

<p>In September 2023, I relocated to the United Kingdom by the grace of GOD. I continued working in Manufacturing in the UK
but my shift pattern could afford me to continue learning DevOps. One night, while on my job, I got the prompting within
me to return to learning Web Development while I also learn DevOps Engineering.
